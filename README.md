# GENIA corpus v3.02 POS annotations (GENIA tagger variant)

This repository contains the version of the GENIA corpus part-of-speech annotations that were used to train the [GENIA tagger](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/GENIA/tagger/) and in the related experiments of Tsuruoka et al. (2005).

This data is made available separately for reference as the [GENIA corpus v3.02 POS annotation](http://www.geniaproject.org/genia-corpus/pos-annotation) does not specify a train/test split and differs from this version in some aspects of its formatting.

Thanks to Yoshimasa Tsuruoka for providing this data and agreeing to make it available.
